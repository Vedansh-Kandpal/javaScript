// Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are executed when a certain event occurs. 
// For example, the setTimeout function takes a function as its first argument and executes it after a specified number of milliseconds.

// Use setTimeout to execute a callback after 1 second
setTimeout(function() {
    console.log("Hello, world!");
  }, 1000);
